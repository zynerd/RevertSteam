# !!! THIS TOOL NO LONGER WORKSâ€”THE PROJECT HAS SINCE BEEN ABANDONED !!!

# RevertSteam

Made in C#, this Windows forms application automates the process of reverting/downgrading back to the old Steam Library UI.

This project was based off of [Leeson's video](https://youtu.be/bjN6-e3nlPE) on reverting to the old Steam Library UI.

## Download

The latest version can be downloaded from the [releases tab](https://github.com/zynerd/RevertSteam/releases).

## Extras

I've included a [zipped folder](https://u.teknik.io/5yxKB.zip) of all the necessary files on the off chance that Valve removes the files from their server.

## NOTE
https://u.teknik.io is currently giving timeouts, so this script will fail at the 28th file. Additionally, the supplied package is hosted on the same site, so it is also not working. I'm adding these comments in a forked PR in the hopes that the developer will see this and re-host these 2 files in a separate location and update the few lines of code in their download function of the script. Thanks!
