# RevertSteam

Made in C#, this Windows forms application automates the process of reverting/downgrading back to the old Steam Library UI.

This project was based off of [Leeson's video](https://youtu.be/bjN6-e3nlPE) on reverting to the old Steam Library UI.

## Download

The latest version can be downloaded from the [releases tab](https://github.com/zynerd/RevertSteam/releases).

## Extras

I've included a [zipped folder](https://u.teknik.io/5yxKB.zip) of all the necessary files on the off chance that Valve removes the files from their server.
